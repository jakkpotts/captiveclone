## 2023-07-25: Initial Setup and Phase 1 Foundation

Started implementing Phase 1 (Foundation and Core Scanning) of the CaptiveClone project. The primary focus was on establishing the project foundation and implementing core network discovery functionality.

### Completed tasks:

1. Set up project structure:
   - Created main package and module directories
   - Established organization for core modules, utilities, and database components
   - Added hardware abstraction layer for wireless devices

2. Implemented core network discovery functionality:
   - Created NetworkScanner class for scanning wireless networks
   - Added wireless adapter abstractions with monitor mode support
   - Implemented basic captive portal detection logic

3. Created terminal-based user interface:
   - Built command system for interacting with the tool
   - Implemented network listing and detailed information display
   - Added configuration management through the UI

4. Set up database schema:
   - Defined models for networks, captive portals, and portal assets
   - Created database initialization and session management

5. Added utility modules:
   - Configuration management with YAML support
   - Custom exceptions for different error types
   - Logging setup

6. Wrote initial tests:
   - Tests for configuration module
   - Tests for core data models

### Next steps:

1. Complete the scanner implementation with more robust captive portal detection
2. Connect the database to the scanner for persistent storage of discovered networks
3. Enhance the hardware abstraction layer with better adapter detection
4. Implement automated tests for all core components
5. Begin work on the captive portal analysis engine for Phase 2
