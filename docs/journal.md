## 2023-07-25: Initial Setup and Phase 1 Foundation

Started implementing Phase 1 (Foundation and Core Scanning) of the CaptiveClone project. The primary focus was on establishing the project foundation and implementing core network discovery functionality.

### Completed tasks:

1. Set up project structure:
   - Created main package and module directories
   - Established organization for core modules, utilities, and database components
   - Added hardware abstraction layer for wireless devices

2. Implemented core network discovery functionality:
   - Created NetworkScanner class for scanning wireless networks
   - Added wireless adapter abstractions with monitor mode support
   - Implemented basic captive portal detection logic

3. Created terminal-based user interface:
   - Built command system for interacting with the tool
   - Implemented network listing and detailed information display
   - Added configuration management through the UI

4. Set up database schema:
   - Defined models for networks, captive portals, and portal assets
   - Created database initialization and session management

5. Added utility modules:
   - Configuration management with YAML support
   - Custom exceptions for different error types
   - Logging setup

6. Wrote initial tests:
   - Tests for configuration module
   - Tests for core data models

### Next steps:

1. Complete the scanner implementation with more robust captive portal detection
2. Connect the database to the scanner for persistent storage of discovered networks
3. Enhance the hardware abstraction layer with better adapter detection
4. Implement automated tests for all core components
5. Begin work on the captive portal analysis engine for Phase 2

git add -A
git commit -m "Implement Phase 1 foundation with network scanner, hardware abstraction, and terminal UI"

## 2023-08-15: Enhanced Scanner and Hardware Abstraction, Started Portal Analysis

Completed the planned next steps from the previous entry and began implementation of Phase 2 (Portal Analysis and Replication).

### Completed tasks:

1. Enhanced NetworkScanner with robust captive portal detection:
   - Implemented multiple detection methods for captive portals
   - Added support for analyzing redirects and responses
   - Improved detection of authentication requirements
   - Added connection management for testing open networks

2. Connected the database for persistent storage:
   - Integrated NetworkScanner with database models
   - Added session tracking for scan operations
   - Implemented storage and updating of discovered networks
   - Added storage of captive portal information

3. Enhanced the hardware abstraction layer:
   - Improved wireless adapter detection with multiple methods
   - Added chipset detection and capability identification
   - Implemented fallback methods for different environments
   - Added support for monitoring adapter capabilities

4. Implemented comprehensive automated tests:
   - Added tests for NetworkScanner
   - Added tests for WirelessAdapter
   - Added tests for captive portal detection
   - Increased overall test coverage

5. Started implementation of the captive portal analysis engine:
   - Created PortalAnalyzer for extracting portal information
   - Implemented form field detection and analysis
   - Added asset extraction and management
   - Set up headless browser integration for JavaScript support

6. Updated dependencies:
   - Added libraries for web scraping and portal analysis
   - Added HTTP interception tools
   - Included additional networking utilities

### Next steps:

1. Complete the portal analysis engine with more advanced form mapping
2. Implement asset replication functionality
3. Create a basic web interface for managing portal analysis
4. Integrate portal analysis with the main scanner workflow
5. Begin work on the rogue access point system for Phase 3

git add -A
git commit -m "Enhance scanner implementation, connect database, improve adapter detection, and start portal analysis engine"
