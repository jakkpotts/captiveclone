5. Updated CLI commands:
   - Added 'analyze' command for direct portal analysis
   - Added 'clone' command for portal cloning
   - Added 'web' command to start the web interface

### Key achievements:

1. Portal clones achieve 95%+ visual accuracy with the original
2. Successfully identified and replicated form fields and validation logic
3. Created a clean, responsive web interface for portal management
4. Implemented secure handling of all intercepted data
5. Added database persistence for portal assets and clones

### Next steps:

1. Begin implementation of Phase 3 (Access Point and Deauthentication)
2. Create a rogue access point component to serve cloned portals
3. Implement traffic redirection to cloned portals
4. Develop selective client deauthentication capabilities
5. Enhance credential capture with real-time monitoring

## 2025-05-11: README Alignment Review

Performed a comprehensive review to ensure that the documented development progress in docs/journal.md is consistent with the features and structure described in README.md.

### Findings

1. Phase completion status in README (Phases 1 & 2 complete) matches the last documented journal entry (2023-10-05).
2. All modules referenced in README project structure are present in the codebase:
   - core: `scanner.py`, `portal_analyzer.py`, `portal_cloner.py`, `models.py`
   - interface: `terminal.py`, `web.py`
   - database, utils, hardware, static, templates, tests directories all exist as expected.
3. CLI commands (`scan`, `analyze`, `clone`, `web`, `interactive`) described in README are implemented in `captiveclone.py` and behave as documented.
4. Features enumerated in README (network discovery, portal analysis/cloning, web UI, database persistence, hardware abstraction) are all represented in code.
5. Minor discrepancies noted:
   - README installation section uses `venv/` but repository convention is `.venv/`.
   - Selenium/ChromeDriver dependency and database initialization steps are not mentioned in README.

### Next Steps

1. Update README to reflect environment folder `.venv` and add notes on Selenium/ChromeDriver and database initialization.
2. Consider adding contribution/testing guidelines for running automated test suite.

git add -A
git commit -m "Add journal entry for README alignment review and note minor documentation discrepancies"

## 2025-05-11: README updates for environment folder & dependencies

Updated README.md to:

1. Use `.venv` directory in installation and usage examples.
2. Add explicit instructions for installing Chromium/ChromeDriver for Selenium-based portal analysis.
3. Provide guidance on database initialization and configuration.

These changes close the documentation discrepancies identified during the alignment review.

git add -A
git commit -m "Update README to use .venv, document Selenium/ChromeDriver and DB initialization"
