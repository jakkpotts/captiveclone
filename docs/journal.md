## 2025-05-11: README Alignment Review

Performed a comprehensive review to ensure that the documented development progress in docs/journal.md is consistent with the features and structure described in README.md.

### Findings

1. Phase completion status in README (Phases 1 & 2 complete) matches the last documented journal entry (2023-10-05).
2. All modules referenced in README project structure are present in the codebase:
   - core: `scanner.py`, `portal_analyzer.py`, `portal_cloner.py`, `models.py`
   - interface: `terminal.py`, `web.py`
   - database, utils, hardware, static, templates, tests directories all exist as expected.
3. CLI commands (`scan`, `analyze`, `clone`, `web`, `interactive`) described in README are implemented in `captiveclone.py` and behave as documented.
4. Features enumerated in README (network discovery, portal analysis/cloning, web UI, database persistence, hardware abstraction) are all represented in code.
5. Minor discrepancies noted:
   - README installation section uses `venv/` but repository convention is `.venv/`.
   - Selenium/ChromeDriver dependency and database initialization steps are not mentioned in README.

### Next Steps

1. Update README to reflect environment folder `.venv` and add notes on Selenium/ChromeDriver and database initialization.
2. Consider adding contribution/testing guidelines for running automated test suite.

git add -A
git commit -m "Add journal entry for README alignment review and note minor documentation discrepancies"

## 2025-05-11: README updates for environment folder & dependencies

Updated README.md to:

1. Use `.venv` directory in installation and usage examples.
2. Add explicit instructions for installing Chromium/ChromeDriver for Selenium-based portal analysis.
3. Provide guidance on database initialization and configuration.

These changes close the documentation discrepancies identified during the alignment review.

git add -A

## 2025-05-25: Phase 4 Alignment Review and Remaining Task Planning

Conducted a detailed review of recent Phase 4 changes against the functional and non-functional requirements in `docs/PRD.md`.

### Findings

1. **Credential Capture Framework**
   - Form interception, validation, and real-time display implemented.
   - _Missing_: encrypted at-rest storage and role-based access control (RBAC) for the capture dashboard (PRD §Security).
2. **Desktop UI Packaging**
   - No Electron/Tauri packaging yet (PRD §User Interface).
3. **Data Visualisation**
   - Basic tables exist, but charting/graph support (traffic trends, credential stats) still absent.
4. **Real-time Network Mapping**
   - SocketIO feeds connected-client lists but no visual network map (PRD §User Interface).
5. **Notification System**
   - WebSocket pop-ups implemented; desktop notifications (Electron) and alert routing (e-mail/webhook) still outstanding.
6. **Security & Reliability**
   - Automatic recovery and encrypted credential vault pending; error handling largely in place.
7. **README / Docs**
   - README does not yet mention NodeJS/Electron or charting dependencies.

### Action Plan to Complete Phase 4

1. **Electron Desktop Client**
   - Scaffold Electron app (React + Vite) that proxies to Flask backend via REST/WS.
   - Add `electron-builder` config for ARM64 (Raspberry Pi 5) & x64 Linux.
   - Provide `npm run dev` / `npm run build` scripts and integrate with `make electron` target.
2. **Charting & Graphs**
   - Integrate Chart.js via Flask JSON endpoints for credential timelines and AP/client metrics.
   - Add trend analysis & export SVG/PNG.
3. **Real-time Network Map**
   - Use Leaflet.js + D3 force-graph to plot AP and client relationships.
   - Feed data via existing SocketIO channel.
4. **Notification Enhancements**
   - Desktop notifications through Electron `Notification` API.
   - Optional webhook/email integrations; configuration via UI.
5. **Encrypted Storage & RBAC**
   - Encrypt credential table with Fernet key derived from master password.
   - Introduce user accounts & roles (admin/viewer) using Flask-Login.
6. **Documentation Updates**
   - Extend README with NodeJS ≥20, Yarn, Electron build steps, and optional system libs.
   - Add new architecture diagram highlighting desktop client.
7. **Testing & CI**
   - Add Cypress/Electron e2e tests.
   - Update GitHub Actions to build Electron artefacts on ARM & x64.

### Success Criteria Alignment (PRD §Phase 4)
- >90 % credential capture accuracy maintained with encrypted storage.
- Dashboard latency remains <200 ms after chart & map integrations.
- Cross-platform Electron builds succeed on Raspberry Pi 5.
