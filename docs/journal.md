### Findings

1. Phase completion status in README (Phases 1 & 2 complete) matches the last documented journal entry (2023-10-05).
2. All modules referenced in README project structure are present in the codebase:
   - core: `scanner.py`, `portal_analyzer.py`, `portal_cloner.py`, `models.py`
   - interface: `terminal.py`, `web.py`
   - database, utils, hardware, static, templates, tests directories all exist as expected.
3. CLI commands (`scan`, `analyze`, `clone`, `web`, `interactive`) described in README are implemented in `captiveclone.py` and behave as documented.
4. Features enumerated in README (network discovery, portal analysis/cloning, web UI, database persistence, hardware abstraction) are all represented in code.

## 2025-05-25: Phase 4 Alignment Review and Remaining Task Planning

Conducted a detailed review of recent Phase 4 changes against the functional and non-functional requirements in `docs/PRD.md`.

### Findings

1. **Credential Capture Framework**
   - Form interception, validation, and real-time display implemented.
   - _Missing_: encrypted at-rest storage and role-based access control (RBAC) for the capture dashboard (PRD §Security).
2. **Desktop UI Packaging**
   - No Electron/Tauri packaging yet (PRD §User Interface).
3. **Data Visualisation**
   - Basic tables exist, but charting/graph support (traffic trends, credential stats) still absent.
4. **Real-time Network Mapping**
   - SocketIO feeds connected-client lists but no visual network map (PRD §User Interface).
5. **Notification System**
   - WebSocket pop-ups implemented; desktop notifications (Electron) and alert routing (e-mail/webhook) still outstanding.
6. **Security & Reliability**
   - Automatic recovery and encrypted credential vault pending; error handling largely in place.
7. **README / Docs**
   - README does not yet mention NodeJS/Electron or charting dependencies.

### Action Plan to Complete Phase 4

1. **Electron Desktop Client**
   - Scaffold Electron app (React + Vite) that proxies to Flask backend via REST/WS.
   - Add `electron-builder` config for ARM64 (Raspberry Pi 5) & x64 Linux.
   - Provide `npm run dev` / `npm run build` scripts and integrate with `make electron` target.
2. **Charting & Graphs**
   - Integrate Chart.js via Flask JSON endpoints for credential timelines and AP/client metrics.
   - Add trend analysis & export SVG/PNG.
3. **Real-time Network Map**
   - Use Leaflet.js + D3 force-graph to plot AP and client relationships.
   - Feed data via existing SocketIO channel.
4. **Notification Enhancements**
   - Desktop notifications through Electron `Notification` API.
   - Optional webhook/email integrations; configuration via UI.
5. **Encrypted Storage & RBAC**
   - Encrypt credential table with Fernet key derived from master password.
   - Introduce user accounts & roles (admin/viewer) using Flask-Login.
6. **Documentation Updates**
   - Extend README with NodeJS ≥20, Yarn, Electron build steps, and optional system libs.
   - Add new architecture diagram highlighting desktop client.
7. **Testing & CI**
   - Add Cypress/Electron e2e tests.
   - Update GitHub Actions to build Electron artefacts on ARM & x64.

### Success Criteria Alignment (PRD §Phase 4)
- >90 % credential capture accuracy maintained with encrypted storage.

## 2025-05-27: Revised Phase 4 Approach - Web-First Implementation

After careful consideration of resource requirements and development efficiency, we have decided to revise our Phase 4 implementation approach to focus exclusively on the web interface rather than developing a separate Electron desktop application.

### Rationale for Change

1. **Hardware Considerations**: The Raspberry Pi 5 target environment has limited resources that would be unnecessarily taxed by Electron's Chromium runtime.
2. **Redundant Functionality**: The existing Flask web interface already provides all the required functionality without the need for OS-level integration.
3. **Development Efficiency**: Focusing on a single codebase (web) rather than maintaining parallel implementations (web + desktop) will accelerate delivery.
4. **Simplicity**: Eliminates additional dependencies (Node.js, Electron) from the deployment requirements.
5. **Accessibility**: A web interface remains accessible from any device on the network without installation requirements.

### Actions Taken

1. Removed `captiveclone/interface/desktop` directory containing initial Electron scaffolding.
2. Revised Phase 4 completion plan to focus entirely on enhancing the web interface.

### Revised Phase 4 Completion Plan

1. **Data Visualization**:
   - Integrate Chart.js directly into Flask templates
   - Add JSON endpoints for credential timeline data and AP/client metrics
   - Implement trend analysis with downloadable SVG/PNG exports

2. **Real-time Network Map**:
   - Add Leaflet.js + D3 force-graph for AP and client relationship visualization
   - Leverage existing SocketIO channels for real-time updates

3. **Enhanced Notification System**:
   - Improve browser notifications using the Web Notifications API
   - Add configurable webhook/email alert options

4. **Security Enhancements**:
   - Implement encrypted credential storage with Fernet
   - Add user accounts & RBAC via Flask-Login

5. **Documentation Updates**:
   - Update requirements.txt with any new Python dependencies
   - Revise PRD implementation notes to reflect the web-only approach

This approach maintains all functional requirements while optimizing for the target environment and simplifying deployment.

git add -A
git commit -m "Revise Phase 4 approach to focus on web interface instead of Electron desktop app"

### Rationale for Web-First Approach:

After careful consideration, we maintained our approach to focus exclusively on the web interface rather than developing a separate Electron desktop application. This decision was based on:

1. Resource optimization for the Raspberry Pi 5 target environment
2. Elimination of redundant functionality between web and desktop
3. Simplicity of deployment and maintenance
