This directory contains audio files that the web interface uses for browser
notifications.  Add your preferred *.mp3* or *.wav* files here.

Recommended filenames (change as needed in `notifications.js`):
  - success.mp3   – played when an operation completes successfully
  - alert.mp3     – played when a credential is captured
  - error.mp3     – played when an error occurs

The application will fall back gracefully if a sound file is missing.
