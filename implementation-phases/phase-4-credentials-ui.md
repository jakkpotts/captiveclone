# Phase 4: Credential Capture and Advanced UI

## Duration: 5 Weeks

### Objectives
- Implement form submission interception
- Securely log and store submitted credentials
- Add frontend dashboard for real-time monitoring
- Implement advanced data visualization and network mapping

### Detailed Tasks

#### Credential Capture
- Create credential interceptor module to capture form submissions
- Implement secure storage with Fernet encryption
- Build credential sorting, filtering, and export functionality
- Add validation for different credential types

#### Advanced UI
- Implement interactive dashboard with real-time updates via SocketIO
- Add data visualization with Chart.js:
  - Credential capture timeline
  - Client connection statistics
  - Attack success rate
- Create real-time network map using D3.js force-directed graph:
  - Visual representation of access points and clients
  - Status indicators for different client states
  - Interactive drag-and-drop functionality

#### Enhanced Notifications
- Implement browser-based notifications using Web Notifications API
- Add sound alerts for important events
- Create webhook integration for third-party tools
- Add email notification capability for remote monitoring

#### Security Enhancements
- Encrypt sensitive credential fields in storage
- Add user authentication and role-based access control options
- Implement session management and secure token handling
- Add audit logging for security events

### Implementation Notes

The implementation focuses on web-based technologies for broader compatibility:
- Uses Chart.js for data visualization instead of desktop-specific libraries
- Implements browser notifications instead of OS-level notifications
- Leverages web standards for maximum compatibility across devices
- Ensures responsive design for both desktop and mobile access

This approach provides the following advantages:
- Better resource utilization on target hardware (Raspberry Pi 5)
- Simpler deployment without additional runtime dependencies
- Cross-platform accessibility from any device on the network
- Easier maintenance with a single unified codebase

### Success Criteria
- Successful capture of credential input for >90% of tested portals
- Real-time dashboard updates under load
- UI responsiveness under 200ms latency
- Secure credential storage with encryption
- Functional notification delivery across configured channels
